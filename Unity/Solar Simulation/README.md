# Solar Simulation## Intro: A simple GUI to simulate the heating process of a solar heating system.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Solar_Simulation/base.png)*Default view*![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Solar_Simulation/running.png)*Running view*## Modeling:This model consists of: 1. a heater heating the water in it, 2. a stock storing the water, 3. two pipes connecting previous water containers,4. 1000 "water cubes" representing all the water in this system. ## Assumption:1. The system is full of water, the total volume equals the volume of water.2. Initially, all the water (water cubes) has the same initial temperature.3. The range of water temperature is 0&deg;C ~ 100&deg;C.4. Energy exchanging among water cubes is ignored.5. Energy loss to outside of the system is ignored.  6. Thermal expansion is ignored.## Input:### Static:Inputs that can only be set when simulation is stopped and can not be changed while simulation is running, including:1. Heater volume (L),2. Stock volume (L),3. Pipe1 radius (m),4. Pipe1 length (m),5. Pipe2 radius (m),6. Pipe2 length (m),7. Water initial temperature (&deg;C).### Dynamic:Inputs that can be set anytime, even during the simulation, including:1. Heater power (w),2. Flow Rate (L/s).![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Solar_Simulation/input.png)*Input fields*## Output:1. Max, average and min water temperature in heater (&deg;C),2. Max, average and min water temperature in stock (&deg;C),3. Simulation time since start (s).![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Solar_Simulation/output.png)*Output text*## Usage:### Before simulation:Set your input in input areas.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Solar_Simulation/input.png)*Input fields*### Start simulation:Press the toggle button to start simulation. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Solar_Simulation/start.png)*Start with toggle button*### During simulation:You can alter the heater power and flow rate.You can pause and continue simulation by pressing toggle button.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Solar_Simulation/duringRunning.png)*Pause, continue and alter*### Reset simulation:Press reset button to stop and reset the simulation. After resetting, the static inputs will be changeable again.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Solar_Simulation/reset.png)*Reset the simulation*
