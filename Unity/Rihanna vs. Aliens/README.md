# Rihanna VS AliensDOWNLOAD GAME PACKAGE TO RUN THE GAME.So basically this is a Plants VS Zombies-like tower defense game.Instead of planting peashooters, the player will set Rihanna (and some other things) to fight against aliens.There are 5 levels. Just try it and see where you can get. You can find scripts I used in the C# Scripts folder.PS: It has been six years since Rihanna released her last album and busy with her fashion & beauty business. I am so looking forward to her new music that I made this absurd game, imagining her defends aliens from leaking the new album tracks (which may not exist in the real world).![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Rihanna_vs_Aliens/cover.png)![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Rihanna_vs_Aliens/level1.png)![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Rihanna_vs_Aliens/level2.png)![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Rihanna_vs_Aliens/level3.png)![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Rihanna_vs_Aliens/level4.png)![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayerZongying/Game-Projects/main/img/Rihanna_vs_Aliens/level5.png)
